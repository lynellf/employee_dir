# employee_dir (Treehouse Project 10)

The employee directory project involved obtaining 'employee' information using the [Random User Generator API.](https://randomuser.me/) With the data, 'employee' information is dynamically generated and displayed to the DOM.

Objective Breakdown:

------------------------

## Get and display 12 random users from [The Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/)

Using photos and information that the API provides, you'll display 12 users, along with some basic information:

-   Image

-   First and Last Name

-   Email

-   City

## Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user's row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:

-   Image

-   Name

-   Username

-   Email

-   Cell Number

-   Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, country and post code.

-   Birthdate

####

## Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup.

-   Display the users in a grid or table

-   Add a hover state to the rows of the user table.

-   Make sure there's a way to close the modal window

####

## Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, you'll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters results once they already on the page.

####

## Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.
